- Data model -
--------------

Fretboard: String[6]
String: Fret[12]
Fret: { note: string, highlight: bool }

// Eventually make an angular mapping thing for the note names / indices

Create a method that takes in a note, converts it to noteindex, and then maths it to get the major key
The method that will invoke that will then assign that array to a variable in the scope
Then call the tune -> buildstring method
Modify buildstring to always check the key to see if anything should be highlighted
